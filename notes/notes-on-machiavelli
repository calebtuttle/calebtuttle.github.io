# Notes on Machiavelli

I just finished reading *The Prince*.

I am impressed and intrigued. Because our colloquial language (and even academic language, if you look in the psychological literature) uses the term "Machiavellian" to refer to someone without morals, I was expecting Machiavelli to sound something like Neitzsche in his elitism and deliberate opposition to traditional morality, except I expected Machiavelli to be simpler and less interesting than Nietzsche since he's categorized as a political philosopher (i.e., a philosopher whose thoughts are probably uninteresting). Machiavelli's ideas, however, are more sophisticated than suggested by the meaning of "Machiavellian," and their simplicity is elegant, not naive.

The takeaway from *The Prince* is the following principle.

> To preserve your state, act to preserve your state, and assume others will act to preserve theirs.

Your state consists of your status, your power, your reputation, your glory, your property. The principle prunes one's decision tree. The first independent clause guides one's actions, and the second provides a heuristic for strategizing with and against other actors.

I'm most impressed and intrigued by how analytic Machiavelli is. His analyticity is not as elegant as Newton's mathematics, but it resembles Newton's reductive approach. The approach assumes that even though there are many complex pheneomena, they can all be explained by a small number of *mechanisms*. For Newton, the prime mechanism is force. For Machiavelli, it is the human desire for glory. If one understands the mechanism, one can predict how dominoes fall and construct levers that move the world.

Something interesting that Machiavelli only implies is that different groups of people have different fundamental mechanisms. In *The Prince*, Machiavelli is concerned only with princes, i.e., the most powerful elite. A prince values the maintenance of his state more than anything. But what does a farmer value more than anything? What does a nobleman value? What about a middle class teacher? A software developer? A lawyer? A pastor? A high school student? A business owner? A salesperson? It seems that successfully navigating the social seas requires an understanding of the mechanisms of a variety of groups. Of course, if one's goal is power and glory, and if you already occupy a powerful position, then you don't have to consider many mechanisms other than the one Machiavelli spends so much time illustrating, i.e., the one encapsulated in the principle above.
