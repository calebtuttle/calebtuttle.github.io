title: A transactionist approach to friendship
---

(Forgive me. These reflections aren't informed.)

(This piece uses the numbering system from the [_Tractatus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus) where 1.1 elaborates on 1.0 and 1.11 elaborates on 1.1.)

1.0 - All friendship is transactional.

1.1 - That is, one's relationship with a friend is an ongoing exchange.

1.2 - This is most apparent when the transactional agreement is opaque to one or both parties. 

1.21 - For example, we see this all the time in romantic relationships, where infatuation causes some of the faculties of the parties involved to be temporarily disfunctional. When such faculties regain functionality, partners often become disenchanted with each other, and admiration dwindles.

1.3 - One might object that if friendship is transactional, why do friends stick with each other? Why do we not jump from friend to friend, always pursuing the most expedient friendships and forgetting everyone who can no longer serve our immediate wishes? I think this objection views human motivation too narrowly. This objection would be sensible if humans _only_ pursued money, _only_ pursued sexual stimulation, etc. But human motivation is complex. Importantly, human motivations include items that might be categorized as altruistic,[^1] and there are many documented biases that inform our decision-making.[^2] These complex motivations and biases are at play in friendship.

1.31 - I would like to spend more time responding to the objection in 1.2.

2.0 - The easiest friendships are the most predictable. In easy friendships, each party expects to give what the other expects to receive.

2.1 - This matching of expectations is often tacit. You and your friend happen to "get along," so you continue in your friendship. 

2.11 - There are, however, cultural ways of matching these expectations. Almost all institutions provide such a service, even if it is a very poor one. For example, a member of a book club expects certain things from her friends in the club, namely, a regular conversation about the books they read. This is an obvious example, but something similar happens at almost every location on the social map. The people at the gym are, potentially, your friends with respect to weight lifting. Your classmates are potentially your friends with respect to the class material. Depending on the context, different kinds of expectations are available. It is ok to expect a spot from a gym-friend (and to provide a spot to a gym-friend), but the spotting-expectation is a distant one for potential classroom friends.

2.2 - By "easy friendship" I mean a friendship that takes relatively little time to develop and relatively little effort to maintain.

2.21 - The qualification "relatively" is important. Both friends, for example, might be difficult people and be living through difficult circumstances. Such a friendship can be described as easy because Friend A is superior to Friend B's potential friends at continually anticipating and meeting Friend B's expectations (and so is Friend B superior to Friend A's potential friends).
