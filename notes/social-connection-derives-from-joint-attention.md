# Social Connection Derives From Joint Attention

**U x 5 claim.** Social psychologists have been studying social connection for some time. However, the causes of feelings of social connection are still a mystery. How and why feelings of social connection arise is unknown. In this paper, I argue that feelings of social connection derive from certain kinds of joint attention. Further, I argue that the psychological mechanism responsible for feelings of social connection is a broader mechanism responsible for reciprocating cooperative and uncooperative behavior. I separate this paper into two sections. In the first section, I articulate the hypothesis that feelings of social connection can be caused by certain kinds of joint attention. In the second section, I argue for an evolutionary psychology explanation of this joint-attention theory of social connection.

**U x 4 claim.** My proposal can be separated into two parts, the first of which is more empircal and the second of which is more theoretical: (1) certain kinds of joint attention induce feelings of social connection (and feelings of social connection mostly derive from these kinds of joint attention), and (2) we might explain this causal link between joint attention and feelings of social connection with an evolutionary psychology approach, saying that feelings of connection promote cooperative behavior by rewarding us for attending to (a) the goals of other humans and (b) the needs of other humans. Note it is possible for (1) to be true without (2) being true, but it is not possible for (2) to be true without (1) being true.

**U x 3 claim.** Humans evolved to have both the capacity to be cooperative (even sacrificial) and the capacity to be uncooperative (even hostile) [ref ref ref]. Developmental psychologists have identified differences in sociality (i.e., in attachment styles) that derive from early-life interactions (or lack thereof) between infant and caregiver. It has been proposed that social cognition (i.e., the ability to recognize that another person has intentions and beliefs that can differ from one's own and that can be mistaken) and the development of language starts with joint attention [Tomasello 1995]. I propose that the crucial role of joint attention in social cognition extends beyond developmental years, throughout the lifetime. Specifically, I propose that feelings of social connection derive from certain kinds and frequencies of joint attention. I attempt to connect this account of feelings of social connection to an evolutionary psychology perspective; I argue that feelings of social connection are an adaptation to promote cooperative behavior.
[Maybe: The social behaviors that are responses to increases or decreases in feelings of social connection in adulthood are relatively short term. The social connection that results from joint attention (or lack thereof) in childhood is almost the same phenomenon as what happens in adulthood, but because of the plasticity of the young, the signals that drive feelings of social connection are felt more strongly--they are branded onto our brains. That is, signals for social connection are the same for an infant as they are for an adult (i.e., in both cases the signals consist of joint attention with attention being directed toward meeting needs), but the infant's *perception* of those signals is more powerful, more effecting, to the infant's brain than the adult's perception of those signals.]

**Updated updated claim.** What we call "social connection" between a dyad derives from joint attention, especially recipricol exchanges of joint attention directed toward meeting the needs of the members of the dyad. When basic needs are met (e.g., hunger, thirst, sleepiness, shelter, social connection, self-esteem), social connection is a function of simply affect-aligned joint attention directed at that which each party would voluntarily direct their attention [i.e., I think, that which each party perceives and acts on most competently]. 

**Updated claim.** My view is that social connection derives from joint attention. Before going further, I note that the term "social connection" ("socail attachment," "social bonding," "friendship," and possibly others) has many meanings. The term is used across many studies in many fields. My goal here is not to define "social connection" as such. As I argue below, there are no satisfactory uses of "social connection" in the literature, despite the many attempts [TODO: change. too harsh]. The term does not entirely carve nature at her joints. My goal here is to articulate a common ground for some seemingly disparate areas of study. This common ground is *joint attention*. I argue that joint attention can help us link findings from developmental psychology, embodied and ecological psychology, evolutionary psychology, and arguments in the philosophy literature on attention, namely that attention is core to demonstrative referents.

**First pass.** I argue that an essential component of social connection in humans (and possibly in other animals) is shared attending (where affective valence of the attending is also shared/mutual). That is, over small timescales, the information that unconsciously triggers in Person A feelings of social connection with Person B consists of signals that Person B is attending to the same (physical or mental) object(s) to which Person A is attending. Feelings of social connection over short timescales (e.g., minutes) linger, establishing a history and propensity for the person to feel those feelings longer and more frequently (i.e., the feelings persist in the way an action persists as an increased tendency to perform the action). Feelings of social connection over long timescales (e.g., years) are a function of feelings of social connection over short timescales. (I.e., feelings of social connection over *short* time scales are to feelings of social connection over *long* time scales what single actions are to habits.)
[TODO: Add affectivity and motivational/goal qualifiers.]
[TODO: Enactvize this claim, eventually, if you can.]

**The contribution of this paper.** Research has shown the importance of social connection on health, feelings of well-being, [this, that, and the other]. Social connection has been studied at the neurological and behavioral levels, but no attempts have been made to articulate broad characteristics of social connection, to my knowledge. That is, neural and behavioral corrlates of reported social connection have been documented, but little has been said about what social connection derives from at short timescales (i.e., seconds or minutes). I argue that social connection starts at shared attending (where affective valence is also shared/mutual). A dyad will feel less socially connected the less they simultaneously attend some (physical or mental) object, while a dyad will feel more socially connected the more they simultaneously attend the object. This view of social connection as deriving from shared attending aligns with the vast literature that argues that the perception-action system in humans evolved for cooperation and that this system is naturally attuned to information gathered from the ecology and other persons about cooperation [ref ref ref]. Crucially, this approach to social connection allows for social connection to occur through conversation. No other studies, to my knowledge, have put forward accounts of social connection that allow social connection to arise from conversation.


Driving questions:
- What is social connection (at the behavioral and phenomenological levels, not at the neurological or sociological level)?
- How is social connection adaptive? Why do humans need it? (Answer: it helps them cooperate to meet each other's needs.)
- Why is joint attention important?
  - Joint attention has been used to explain the development of language, the development of basic social cognition between infant and caregiver [ref!?], and the attachment style and social competence of humans. It seems plausible that feelings of social connection are an extension of this. Language, social cognition, and social competence facilitate cooperation between humans. It seems plausible that feelings of social connection exist to reward adaptive, cooperative behaviors and that feelings of social disconnection exist to punish maladaptive, uncooperative behaviors. Feelings of social connection, however, must derive from something since they cannot magically be placed inside someone by others. No, feelings of social connection within a person are encodings of a signal perceived from others. A person's perception (or delusion) of joint attention is a signal to that person that they are perceived as cooperative.
    - Maybe: Social connection, then, is like a more particular version of self-esteem. Sociometer theory states that self-esteem is one's perception of *generalized and anonymous* other's perception of one's value. What I am proposing about social connection suggests that social connection is one's perception of a *specific* other's perception of one's cooperativeness (but maybe also of one's value). So, self-esteem (general) and feelings of social connection (associated with a particular set of people) fulfill similar, if not the same, general function: to indicate to one others' perceptions of one's value. However, feelings of social connection contain more specific information, i.e., information about *who* perceives one as cooperative/valuable. 


NOTES on evolutionary psychology:
- "Here is how Elliott Sober defines an adaptation: “characteristic *c* is an adaptation for doing task *t* in a population if and only if members of the population now have *c* because, ancestrally, there was selection for having *c* and *c* conferred a fitness advantage because it performed task *t*” (Sober 2000, 85)." [from [SEP entry on evolutionary psychology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evolutionary-psychology/#BioVsEvoPsy)]
  - [To make your argument about feelings of social connection being an adaptation, then, you need to find support for the following claim: **The characteristic of *responding reciprocally to signals of cooperation (or lack of cooperation)* (where these signals are primarily through joint attention) was selected for to accomplish many tasks [TODO: example]**.
    - Look into research on:
      - Singing together boosts feelings of social connection]
- My claim is that the *ability* of humans to ontogenetically adapt to cooperative or hostile actions is itself a phylogenetic adaptation.

Key question: Bodily coordination increases feelings of social connection. What about mental coordination in conversation? Surely conversational/mental coordination increases feelings of social connection too?

Look into research on shared attention, mental attention, and attention generally.

## 1. Introduction??
I separate this paper into two sections: one focused on claims that are more testable, the other focused on more theoretical matters. I make this separation because the hypothesis in Section 2 might be fruitful regardless of the theoretical matters. I include the theoretical matters in order to integrate my claims with the evolutionary psychology literature. 

## 2. Joint Attention Causes Feelings of Social Connection
The core empirical claim of this paper is that certain kinds of joint attention give rise to feelings of social connection. [TODO: What kinds of joint attention??]

There is broad consensus that there is a link between joint attention and social cognition, i.e., the ability to recognize others as intentional agents with minds and beliefs of their own [Tomasello, Mundy, ref ref ref]. Developmental psychologists have noted differences in social competence between neurotypical children and children with autism [Mundy, ref, ref]. While neurotypical children demonstrate competence in both initiating joint attention and responding to bids for joint attention, children with autism have significant deficits in initiating joint attention and small deficits in responding to bids for joint attention [Mundy: Attention, Joint Attention, and Social Cognition]. Additionally, "young children acquire the vast majority of their first words in joint attentional interactions with adults and objects (see Bruner 1983; Tomasello & Todd 1983)" [Tomasello 1995].

Despite the large amount of research on joint attention and social cognition, the potential relationship between joint attention and social connection has not been explored, though it has been suggested. While considering future directions for future research, [Mundy (2007)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00518.x) suggests, "A deeper appreciation of the interpersonal [...] factors [...] that are critical to some types of joint attention will also be indespensible." 

#### [Reinterpreting the literature as expressing my view.]
A number of empirical findings suggest joint attention plays a role in social connection. However, to my knowledge, no studies have directly tested whether or how joint attention affects feelings of social connection. 

One area of research that I believe coheres with my proposal that feelings of social connection are caused by joint attention is *capitalization* research. "Capitalization is an interpersonal process wherein capitalizers retell their personal good news to responders. This process is termed “capitalizing” because through this interaction, capitalizers may reap additional benefits, over and above the original value of the positive event (Gable et al. 2004; Langston, 1994)" [(Peters, Reis, and Gable 2018)](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12407).
[Gable, et al. (2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15301629/), building on [Langston (1994)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-09445-001), report that "Two studies showed that communicating personal positive events with others was associated with increased daily positive affect and well-being, above and beyond the impact of the positive event itself and other daily events." They offer two explanations for why communicating personal positive events (an activity termed "capitalizing") might be beneficial. First, it allows the capitalizer to relive the experience. Second, it allows the capitalizer to "build social resources" and to perceive their interlocutor as being "pleased for them" (Gable, et a. 2004). The second explanation is pertinent to my proposal. Sharing an experience with someone (even if it is imagined or co-imagined, if you will) involves joint attention. The particular kind of joint attention that occurs when sharing good news is one kind of joint attention that, I propose, causes feelings of social connection. This sort of joint attention involves, possibly, in some cases, a shared goal [TODO: look at the actual studies to see if this is correct]. It also involves shared positive affect. Under this reconceptualization of the events of the study, then each participant in this study engaged in joint attention where the joint attention was colored by positive affect. If this analysis holds, the participants experienced increased well-being after engaging in joint attention with someone whose attention was characterized by the same affect and valence that characterized the attention of the person sharing. I believe this shared attention, this situtation in which an object and the affect and valence through which one views the object are shared between two people, is a central cause in feelings of social connection.

[Peters, Reis, and Gable, (2018)](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12407) review the literature on the capitalization process, covering the outcomes and mechanisms of capitalization for both capitalizers and responders. ["The mechanisms they propose are all coherent with my view."]

#### [Relating my proposal to sociometer theory]
Leary and Baumeister (2000) introduced sociometer theory, which casts self-esteem as a psychological mechanism that gauges one's level of belongingness. Self-esteem thus provides critical information about whether one should change or continue one's behaviors to avoid being ostricized from the group. [In their words: "We have proposed that self-esteem operates as an internal measure of one's potential for inclusion in desirable groups and relationships. It is thus essentially a meter that serves to monitor, regulate, and maintain interpersonal attachments, and it is designed to motivate behaviors to increase inclusion and forestall rejection." (p.24).] The seminal concept of a "sociometer" accounts for certain kinds of behavior [ref ref ref. TODO: be more specific about kinds of behavior]. However, the theory, in focusing on self-esteem exclusively, misses a key aspect of human behavior: We signal and respond to signals of belongingness not only at the group level but also at the individual level. In other words, yes, self-esteem provides a gauge of my belongingness within a group, but I also act on information about my relationship with particular people. I spend more time with one person than another, even within the same group, for reasons that have to do with a sense of belongingness. **Feelings of social connection seem to be individual-individual signals of belongingness, while self-esteem is an individual-group belongingness.**


The importance of joint attention in sociality:
- "Adolescents and adults who cannot follow, initiate, or join with the rapid-fire changes of shared attention in social interactions may be impaired in their capacity for relatedness and relationships." [from Attention, Joint Attention, and Social Cognition]

### Attention
- What is attention?
- What is joint attention?
  - [Tomasello (1995)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Joint_Attention/-SIBAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=joint+attention+as+social+cognition&pg=PA103&printsec=frontcover) describes joint attention in the context of developmental psychology, though his articulation of the criteria for joint attention are relevant for us here.
    - "The overall point is that joint attention does not just mean two people looking at the same thing at the same time. Nor is it just one person looking on while another engages with an object, nor is it the child alternating her attention between two phenomena (person and object) of equal interest. In joint attention the child coordinates her attention to the object and the adult at the same time that the adult coordinates her attention to the same object and the child. And in both cases this coordination is of a very special nature. The coordination that takes place in joint attentional interactions is accomplished by means of an understanding that the other participant has a focus of attention to the same entity as the self. This implies an understanding of the other participant *not* as an object or capturer of attention or potential punisher, but as a *person* who intentionally perceives a certain aspect of the environment that is *the same* as one's own, or could be made *the same*. There is thus a notion that the participants are sharing an intentional relation to the world (Hobson, 1989)."

- Attention and language:
  - From [Tomasello (1995, p. 115)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Joint_Attention/-SIBAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=joint+attention+as+social+cognition&pg=PA103&printsec=frontcover): "I take it as axiomatic that when humans use language to communicate referentially they are attempting to manipulate the attention of another person or persons (see Talmy, 1993)."
    - Tomasello argues that "young children acquire the vast majority of their first words in joint attentional interactions with adults and objects (see Bruner 1983; Tomasello & Todd 1983)."

### Problems with current (and some other possible) views/definitions of social connection - examples
- There is no comprehensive account of social connection which can explain why someone can feel lonely while being in the presence of others [maybe temper this claim? Is it correct?]. 
- No account of social connection can explain how social connection can arise through conversations through mere text (e.g., through physical letters ("snail mail"), email, text messaging).
  - My proposal, focusing on attention (where attention can be directed at mental objects), allows people in different physical locations to be directed at the same (or sufficiently similar) mental objects (e.g., through imagination when referencing a commonly known movie or through informational/conceptual processing when referencing a commonly known philosophical idea).
  - Although this study ([Opioids and social bonding: naltrexone reduces feelings of social connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847702/)) 


## 2. My Proposal


## 3. How does it relate to sociometer theory and hierometer theory?
- [Heirometer theory](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00334/full)

My proposal of a psychological mechanism that regulates feelings of social connection based on the character and frequency of joint attention relates more to one's perception of individual humans rather than groups of humans. Theories of self-esteem and self-regard relate to groups. Sociometer theory and hierometer theory suggest psychological mechanisms that deal with an internalized, anonymous other. The mechanisms in these theories are relatively indifferent to the number of people who influence one's self-regard; if Alice's whole family holds her in high regard, it doesn't matter whether she has 2 siblings and 2 cousins or 10 siblings and 50 cousins. In what I am proposing, it matters very much whether Alice jointly attends an object with Bob rather than with Charlie since her feelings of social connection can discriminate between different people.
