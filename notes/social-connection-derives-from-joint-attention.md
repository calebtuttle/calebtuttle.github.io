# Social Connection Derives From Joint Attention

**Updated updated claim.** What we call "social connection" between a dyad derives from joint attention, especially recipricol exchanges of joint attention directed toward meeting the needs of the members of the dyad. When basic needs are met (e.g., hunger, thirst, sleepiness, shelter, social connection, self-esteem), social connection is a function of simply affect-aligned joint attention directed at that which each party would voluntarily direct their attention [i.e., I think, that which each party perceives and acts on most competently]. 

**Updated claim.** My view is that social connection derives from joint attention. Before going further, I note that the term "social connection" ("socail attachment," "social bonding," "friendship," and possibly others) has many meanings. The term is used across many studies in many fields. My goal here is not to define "social connection" as such. As I argue below, there are no satisfactory uses of "social connection" in the literature, despite the many attempts [TODO: change. too harsh]. The term does not entirely carve nature at her joints. My goal here is to articulate a common ground for some seemingly disparate areas of study. This common ground is *joint attention*. I argue that joint attention can help us link findings from developmental psychology, embodied and ecological psychology, evolutionary psychology, and arguments in the philosophy literature on attention, namely that attention is core to demonstrative referents.

**First pass.** I argue that an essential component of social connection in humans (and possibly in other animals) is shared attending (where affective valence of the attending is also shared/mutual). That is, over small timescales, the information that unconsciously triggers in Person A feelings of social connection with Person B consists of signals that Person B is attending to the same (physical or mental) object(s) to which Person A is attending. Feelings of social connection over short timescales (e.g., minutes) linger, establishing a history and propensity for the person to feel those feelings longer and more frequently (i.e., the feelings persist in the way an action persists as an increased tendency to perform the action). Feelings of social connection over long timescales (e.g., years) are a function of feelings of social connection over short timescales. (I.e., feelings of social connection over *short* time scales are to feelings of social connection over *long* time scales what single actions are to habits.)
[TODO: Add affectivity and motivational/goal qualifiers.]
[TODO: Enactvize this claim, eventually, if you can.]

**The contribution of this paper.** Research has shown the importance of social connection on health, feelings of well-being, [this, that, and the other]. Social connection has been studied at the neurological and behavioral levels, but no attempts have been made to articulate broad characteristics of social connection, to my knowledge. That is, neural and behavioral corrlates of reported social connection have been documented, but little has been said about what social connection derives from at short timescales (i.e., seconds or minutes). I argue that social connection starts at shared attending (where affective valence is also shared/mutual). A dyad will feel less socially connected the less they simultaneously attend some (physical or mental) object, while a dyad will feel more socially connected the more they simultaneously attend the object. This view of social connection as deriving from shared attending aligns with the vast literature that argues that the perception-action system in humans evolved for cooperation and that this system is naturally attuned to information gathered from the ecology and other persons about cooperation [ref ref ref]. Crucially, this approach to social connection allows for social connection to occur through conversation. No other studies, to my knowledge, have put forward accounts of social connection that allow social connection to arise from conversation.

Integrate [Social Connection Through Joint Action...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2009.01022.x) and [The Neural Correlates of Social Connection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263704797_The_neural_correlates_of_social_connection).

Key question: Bodily coordination increases feelings of social connection. What about mental coordination in conversation? Surely conversational/mental coordination increases feelings of social connection too?

Look into research on shared attention, mental attention, and attention generally.

### Overview of Literature on Social Connection
Cover:
- Attachment theory!!
  - 4 attachment styles
- Social cooperation
  - Embodied/ecological perspective: [Social Connection Through Joint Action and Interpersonal Coordination](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2009.01022.x)
  - Evolutionary perspective: [The Social Constitution of
Perceiver-Environment Reciprocity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228874672_The_social_constitution_of_perceiver-environment_reciprocity)
- Social connection as a feeling:
  - First, look into the "brain opioid theory of social attachment" (see [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847702/))
  - Neurological perspective: [The Neural Correlates of Social Connection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263704797_The_neural_correlates_of_social_connection)
    - [Note differences in how the term "social connection" is used. This paper uses it to refer to feelings of love, care, connection, friendship. The paper below, "Opioids and Social Connection," uses it to refer to "the experience of feeling close to and bonded with other people."]

### Attention
- What is attention?
- What is joint attention?
  - [Tomasello (1995)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Joint_Attention/-SIBAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=joint+attention+as+social+cognition&pg=PA103&printsec=frontcover) describes joint attention in the context of developmental psychology, though his articulation of the criteria for joint attention are relevant for us here.
    - "The overall point is that joint attention does not just mean two people looking at the same thing at the same time. Nor is it just one person looking on while another engages with an object, nor is it the child alternating her attention between two phenomena (person and object) of equal interest. In joint attention the child coordinates her attention to the object and the adult at the same time that the adult coordinates her attention to the same object and the child. And in both cases this coordination is of a very special nature. The coordination that takes place in joint attentional interactions is accomplished by means of an understanding that the other participant has a focus of attention to the same entity as the self. This implies an understanding of the other participant *not* as an object or capturer of attention or potential punisher, but as a *person* who intentionally perceives a certain aspect of the environment that is *the same* as one's own, or could be made *the same*. There is thus a notion that the participants are sharing an intentional relation to the world (Hobson, 1989)."

From [Tomasello (1995, p. 115)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Joint_Attention/-SIBAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=joint+attention+as+social+cognition&pg=PA103&printsec=frontcover): "I take it as axiomatic that when humans use language to communicate referentially they are attempting to manipulate the attention of another person or persons (see Talmy, 1993)."
  - Tomasello argues that language develops

### Problems with current (and some other possible) views/definitions of social connection - examples
- There is no comprehensive account of social connection which can explain why someone can feel lonely while being in the presence of others [maybe temper this claim? Is it correct?]. 
- No account of social connection can explain how social connection can arise through conversations through mere text (e.g., through physical letters ("snail mail"), email, text messaging).
  - My proposal, focusing on attention (where attention can be directed at mental objects), allows people in different physical locations to be directed at the same (or sufficiently similar) mental objects (e.g., through imagination when referencing a commonly known movie or through informational/conceptual processing when referencing a commonly known philosophical idea).
  - Although this study ([Opioids and social bonding: naltrexone reduces feelings of social connection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847702/))
