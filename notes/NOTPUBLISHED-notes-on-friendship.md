# Notes on friendship

A friend (during conversations) opens doors to worlds which afford you many happy thoughts.

<hr/>

[A piece from _The Guardian_ that highlights the need for friendship in the US.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/18/loneliness-coping-with-the-gap-where-friends-used-to-be)

<hr/>

Friendship is aligned attunement to things in the world.

An artificial neural network _attunes_ itself to its dataset.

If we can represent somebody's attunements (through neuroimaging, say), we can determine who will be easy friends.

(Attunement is always attunement _to_ something. One can be more or less attuned to the conversations around them, to noises around them, to noises within them, etc. One can also be attuned to the show they're watching on Netflix or a song they're listening to on Spotify or a book they're reading.)

<hr/>

It is very difficult for a friend to end a friendship. (This is true more so for some people and less so for others.) 

<hr/>

What do we get from watching talk shows and game shows? (And why does watching talk shows, game shows, movies, podcasts, etc. partially satisfy a need for social interaction? Why am I more inclined to watch YouTube on days in which I have had very little social interaction?)

<hr/>

Tinder-like apps are (probably) just ways for attractive people to meet attractive people.

This is true of Tinder and other dating apps, but it is also likely true of apps--like Yubo and BumbleBFF--that provide a platform for platonic relationships.
There is no good option for other people.

Another observation: The multitude of (_apparent_) options on apps like these is overwhelming to people who are more introverted.
The multitude of options also distorts the user's perception of exactly who might be friends with the user. By this I mean, the average-looking person might have the illusion that an attractive person is equally drawn to them (an average-looking person) and to other beautiful people; this likely prevents one from pursuing those potential relationships which are more likely to develop.

Another observation: These apps expect us to consciously filter through all the options and to find the best friends/partners. This is an extremely naive view of how humans become friends. Tinder-like apps place an enourmous information processing burden on their users. They expect people to (a) know themselves well enough to know who they would be good friends with and (b) _consciously_ filter through the hundreds or thousands of options to find a best fit. 
This approach is naive because the filters through which our friends went through before they became our friends are predominantly _not conscious_. It is often the case that friendships develop out of some mutual thrownness. You and I, for example, attend the same church (note that this fact alone eliminates >90% of the pool of potential friends). At the church, we sit in the same isle or attend the same Bible study (again, an elimination of >50% of the remaining pool). Then, a friendship likely develops out of some shared interest or struggle. This is the most conscious part, _but even this part need not be conscious_. I mean, one does not need to have a conscious detailed inventory of one's own interests to _recognize_ when someone else's interests are similar. Observers may notice the overlap in interest (and one can take on the perspective of an observer), but this observation almost always happens after the fact. _The conditions for friendship consist, at least partially, of a mutual thrownness._ This thrownness is identifiable, but in everyday life, it is overlooked. Thus, to truly provide a solution for friendship--to truly facilitate friendship--one cannot place onto the user the information processing burden of understanding their thrownness, how it is similar to and different from others' thrownness, and just what their interests are.

Dating apps have recognized this to a degree. Their algorithms match people based on personality assessments and such.

## A transactionist approach to friendship
(Forgive me. These reflections aren't informed.)

(Inherits the numbering system from the _Tractatus_.)

1.0 - All friendship is transactional.

1.1 - That is, one's relationship with a friend is an ongoing exchange.

1.2 - This is most apparent when the transactional agreement is opaque to one or both parties. 

1.21 - For example, we see this all the time in romantic relationships, where infatuation causes some of the faculties of the parties involved to be temporarily disfunctional. When such faculties regain functionality, partners often become disenchanted with each other, and admiration dwindles.

1.3 - One might object that if friendship is transactional, why do friends stick with each other? Why do we not jump from friend to friend, always pursuing the most expedient friendships and forgetting everyone who can no longer serve our immediate wishes? I think this objection views human motivation too narrowly. This objection would be sensible if humans _only_ pursued money, _only_ pursued sexual stimulation, etc. But human motivation is complex. Importantly, human motivations include items that might be categorized as altruistic,[^1] and there are many documented biases that inform our decision-making.[^2] These complex motivations and biases are at play in friendship.

1.31 - I would like to spend more time responding to the objection in 1.2.

2.0 - The easiest friendships are the most predictable. In easy friendships, each party expects to give what the other expects to receive.

2.1 - This matching of expectations is often tacit. You and your friend happen to "get along," so you continue in your friendship. 

2.11 - There are, however, cultural ways of matching these expectations. Almost all institutions provide such a service, even if it is a very poor one. For example, a member of a book club expects certain things from her friends in the club, namely, a regular conversation about the books they read. This is an obvious example, but something similar happens at almost every location on the social map. The people at the gym are, potentially, your friends with respect to weight lifting. Your classmates are potentially your friends with respect to the class material. Depending on the context, different kinds of expectations are available. It is ok to expect a spot from a gym-friend (and to provide a spot to a gym-friend), but the spotting-expectation is a distant one for potential classroom friends.

2.2 - By "easy friendship" I mean a friendship that takes relatively little time to develop and relatively little effort to maintain.

2.21 - The qualification "relatively" is important. Both friends, for example, might be difficult people and be living through difficult circumstances. Such a friendship can be described as easy because Friend A is superior to Friend B's potential friends at continually anticipating and meeting Friend B's expectations (and so is Friend B superior to Friend A's potential friends).

3.0 - For future thought: If all friendship is transactional, how can we optimize these transactions?

3.1 - How can we help people identify what they expect to receive from a friend (how do we determine what we need/want)? How can we help each other fulfill the expectations of others? (A normative question) How do we modify our expectations to align with the good?

### From an episode of _The Happiness Lab_
In [one episode of _The Happiness Lab_](https://www.happinesslab.fm/season-1-episodes/mistakenly-seeking-solitude), Dr. Laurie Santos discusses the ATM. Why is a happiness psychologist interested in ATMs? She's not interested in the machines but in what the machines replaced: short interactions with bank tellers. 

Before ATMs, anyone wanting to withdraw or deposit money from the bank had to go to a bank and interact with a bank teller. This short interaction might often involve a polite exchange of smiles, an exchange of information, and maybe a polite comment about the weather. 

_This_--this brief exchange is valuable to us. Santos argues that we as humans gain something from a small polite interaction. These small interactions can happen anywhere: at work, at the store, at church, at the bank. But these brief exchanges, which were once peppered throughout one's day, are fading out of our lives because of technology like the ATM. 

The ATM removes the "friction" of human interaction. Self-checkouts and contactless delivery remove the unnecessary brief exchanges.

Santos' argument--that these moments of exchanging almost nothing but politeness--points to something about our need for connection and, I think, about the nature of friendship.

What does this say about friendship? I believe our need for such small exchanges is one need (among many) that friendship often meets. This category of exchange might even be one of the basic components of friendship and might be one of the most pervasive. 

To illustrate, many friends in many cultures greet each other enthusiastically. I think many interactions are exchanges very similar to those of a greeting. If you observe interactions--particularly ones characterized by positive affect--you notice that most of _what is exchanged_ is useless, meaningless, and forgotten outside of the context in which it is exchanged. I mean the jokes, the did-you-see-the-games, the can-you-believe-what-richard-dids. I suppose this all might be categorized as "superficial" exchanges. My contention (and here I am just emphasizing Santos' point) is that these superficial exchanges are a core component of human connection and, I think, of friendship.

What is involved in these superficial exchanges except mostly affective information? I believe these exchanges rely heavily on our embodiment. If we sought to further break down this category of exchanges, we will likely find that it mostly consists of tone of voice, gestures, facial expressions, and so on. The information ("information" as in conceptual, intellectual, context-independent, etc.) conveyed is secondary. (It might not even be _necessary_ since it seems possible to enjoy the laughter of those who laugh at a joke we didn't even hear and to grow angry in the presence of an angry person even if we there is no indication as to what caused the anger.)


### The origins of the transcendent aspect of friendship

There is some _transcendent aspect_ of a ong-lasting, good friendship. By this I mean, the impression of my friend's dispositions, etc. reverberates through me even when I am not physically close to my friend. My friend transcends the atomic interactions we've had over the years. This transcendence is the memory and anticipation of my friend.

Assuming Aristotle's categories of friendship, the aspect of friendship which transcends (and binds) the manifold of interactions is found most in friends of the good. The manifold of interactions within a friendship of pleasure or of utility need not be united beyond an amount of unity that provides some sense of continuity.

But this transcendent aspect of friendship is impossible without the manifold. The manifold of interactions is temporally prior to the unity of the internalized friend (and by "internalized friend", I mean not necessarily some internal representation of the friend, but an increased tendency to enact or re-enact interactions (through imagination or otherwise)[^4] with the friend so that one grows more and more attuned to their dispositions, etc.).

This transcendent aspect of friendship--the part that sticks with me when my friend is elsewhere--is not (I think) open to scientific investigation. This is because the transcendent aspect just is the internalized friend. My internalization of my friend's dispositions, etc. is indistinguishable from _my_ dispositions, etc. My attunement to my friend is indistinguishable from _me_ considered outside of the context of the friendship, from me considered independent of the friendship.

The manifold of interactions, however, appears open to scientific investigation. The interactions are visible. We can observe the friends' facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, words, etc. as they converse.

The transcendent aspect of friendship is somewhat open to the scientist because the scientist knows its origins (though it gets complicated quickly because one interacts with the internalized friend, and these interactions shape external interactions, creating a back-and-forth between interactions empircally apparent and interactions available only subjectively). 

So, if we are going to study friendship as it is for the friends (and not as it is for the sociologist or for the teacher telling the friends to quiet down), and if one must include more than oneself in one's study, then we must focus on _the manifold of interactions_.
