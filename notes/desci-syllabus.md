BIG NOTE: This is a work in progress. 

## Prefatory Note
The DeSci ecosystem is growing quickly, and there's a lot to learn. Learning materials, however, are spread across blogs (see [here](https://medium.com/molecule-blog), [here](https://vitadao.medium.com/), [here](https://arye.substack.com/p/building-a-labdao-for-web3-biotech), [here](https://pulse.opsci.io/)), YouTube channels (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiZKdSeJ9VPFR5BtKnbN4fQ), [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ao1jhEL4LHg59MQ-4Zhmg), [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwMN9E4uZ0jYOo9rDuFb0_Q)), Twitter threads (see [here](https://twitter.com/NatHarooni/status/1487041549733142531?s=20&t=WXTShAiNvSRinngtp4NiUw), [here](https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1424104124187033603?s=20&t=w8w0DcavWJZYBl-PVYFudg), [here](https://twitter.com/0xboodle/status/1457140825465364480?s=20&t=rKeOleEeOpBYr_fEzc3ZZg)), Notion boards, and Discord servers. Anyone interested in learning about DeSci has to spend hours combing through these resources just to get a gist of what these DeSci people are up to. This "syllabus" is intended to address this issue.

This resource attempts to present the DeSci ecosystem in an organized way. It includes only the fundamentals, and even though the work being done in DeSci resists categorization, this document separates learning materials into categories as a loose guide. (It seems easier to introduce a subject via familiar categories and progress to the more accurate categories than to introduce the subject using the very categories one learns when learning the subject.)

The syllabus is meant for those who have minimal exposure to both DeSci and Web3. Those who are familiar with DeSci but are interested in a thousand-foot view of the ecosystem might also find it valuable.
