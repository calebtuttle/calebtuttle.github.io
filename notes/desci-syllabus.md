BIG NOTE: This is a work in progress. 

For now, just see the [DeSci Wiki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQC6zn-eXflSmpts0XGE7CawbUEHwnL6o-OFXO52PTc/edit?usp=sharing) curated by Jocelynn Pearl (@jocelynnpearl on Twitter).

## Prefatory Note
The DeSci ecosystem is growing quickly, and there's a lot to learn. Learning materials, however, are spread across blogs (see [here](https://medium.com/molecule-blog), [here](https://vitadao.medium.com/), [here](https://arye.substack.com/p/building-a-labdao-for-web3-biotech), [here](https://pulse.opsci.io/)), YouTube channels (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiZKdSeJ9VPFR5BtKnbN4fQ), [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ao1jhEL4LHg59MQ-4Zhmg), [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwMN9E4uZ0jYOo9rDuFb0_Q)), Tweet threads (see [here](https://twitter.com/heyjudka/status/1471245665032278019?s=20&t=w3ciZ2eutGQqq836OOKyWQ), [here](https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1424104124187033603?s=20&t=w8w0DcavWJZYBl-PVYFudg), [here](https://twitter.com/0xboodle/status/1457140825465364480?s=20&t=rKeOleEeOpBYr_fEzc3ZZg)), Notion boards, and Discord servers. Anyone interested in learning about DeSci has to spend hours combing through these resources just to get a gist of what these DeSci people are up to. This "syllabus" is intended to address this issue of fragmentation.

This resource attempts to present the DeSci ecosystem in an organized way. It includes only the fundamentals, and even though the work being done in DeSci resists categorization, this document separates learning materials into categories as a loose guide. (It seems easier to introduce a subject via familiar categories and progress to the more accurate categories than to introduce the subject using the very categories one learns when learning the subject.)

The syllabus is meant for those who have minimal exposure to both DeSci but some exposure to Web3. Those who are familiar with DeSci but are interested in a thousand-foot view of the ecosystem might also find it valuable. 

## Introduction to DeSci
Before listing the works of others, I want to give DeSci a proper introduction. First, the term _DeSci_ is a conjoining of "decentralized science," but focusing on decentralization can be misleading. The DeSci movement grew out of the broader Web3 movement which seeks to use peer-to-peer protocols, such as the ones that power blockchains, to create a permissionless and trustless web allowing users to be self-sovereign in the digital world. Bitcoin, the original financial blockchain, can be regarded as having been a response to the failure of centralized financial institutions in the 2008 financial crises. Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood pointed to the US government's monitoring of US citizens, as revealed by Edward Snowden, as a key reason society should upgrade the web, an upgrade which Dr. Wood called "Web 3.0."

At its heart, _DeSci is a movement to create better tools to support scientific research_. Decentralization is 

A big feature of DeSci is that it decouples scientific assets and activities that have previously remained coupled. From this decoupling, DeSci is able to create markets between the decoupled entities.
