title: Salience Maps of Affordances - Potential Applications in Psychology
---

(Originally titled "Sentimentalism, Personality, and Affordances")

To have a personality is to have a distinct salience map of affordances.

In other words, if two people are in the same situation, we say their personalities are different to the degree that they experience different affordances.

An individual within an ecology experiences a salience map of affordances. For example, as I sit at my desk, I can do many things: continue typing these words, reach for my water bottle, reach for my phone, reach for my pen, reach for one of my notebooks, reach for a piece of gum, open Spotify to continue listening to music, navigate to Wikipedia, etc. But some of these possible actions are more pressing, more salient, and more available to my conscious experience. (In fact, that some actions came to my mind before others suggests that some have more "affordive weight" for me at this moment.) Each affordance has a weight. For any affordance, we say its "affordive weight" is the probability that it will be acted out (actualized).

If two people are placed in the same physical situation and if they are placed in the same place (or nearly the same place) in the physical situation, then we say their personalities differ to the extent that one person's affordive weights differ from another person's affordive weights.

Affordive weights can probably be gauged via language. In some context, one person will use language a certain way and, more importantly, will simply talk about some things more than others. In the same context, another person will talk about other things and in different ways. Sometimes, two people talk about the same things in the same ways: these people are more likely to be friends [or at least more likely to get married: I'm pretty sure there's research suggesting likes attract rather than the opposite].

Physical actions also indicate affordive weights. An introvert stands closer to the walls, an extravert closer to other people.

Tied to physical actions, physiological signals can likely "color" an affordance map. They can influence it. For example, compared to someone whose adrenaline is low, someone whose adrenaline is high will more likely hit back in the event that another individual physically attacks them.

The example of returning a strike brings several things to my mind. First, Aristotle's notion of courage: The courageous person is the person who is courageous for its own sake, the warrior who leads the charge in battle but remains level-headed enough so as to not be rash. Second, sentimentalism: Passions--and therefore hormones--guide behavior more than rational thought, and this is how things ought to be. So, to my current thinking, we have an example that relates to ideas from Aristotle, sentimentalism, physiology, ecological psychology (with affordance), and topped off with a metaphor from AI (i.e., the metaphor of a salience map of affordances).

(If an affordance's weight is the probability of enacting the affordance, then hormones might be said to be weights of affordances' weights.)

Affordances are pragmatic and epistemic. That is, some capacities for action involve physical movement at the level observable to humans and on timescales greater than, say, 1 second (these are pragmatic); other capacities for action involve thought and speech over physical movement (these are epistemic). [Note: tihs characterization only makes claims about the timescale of seconds and minutes. It says nothing about the timescale of months and years or of milliseconds.]
