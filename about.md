Hello! I'm Caleb. I graduated in 2020 from Belmont University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Philosophy. I'm a software developer, and I really, really like new ideas. 

This site serves as a repository for some of my thoughts. My unconscious generates a number of ideas which _to me_ are novel, enough that I need some outlet for them. Most--maybe all--of these ideas are neither novel nor compelling. Nonetheless, I'm putting some of these thoughts on display in case one of them has merit.
